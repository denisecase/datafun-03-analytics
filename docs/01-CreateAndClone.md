# Create a GitHub Repository and Clone it Down

The recommended, reliable way to start a new GitHub project is to begin in GitHub with at least one file in your repo. 


## 1. Create GitHub Repo

1. In this project, you can start with this template repo or rebuild it in your own, as you like.    
   - Either click the "Use this template" button OR
   - Create a new project repo in GitHub **with a default README.md**. 
2. Go to your new repo in GitHub and copy the URL to clipboard (e.g., <https://github.com/denisecase/datafun-03-analytics>)


## 2. Switch to Local Machine and Clone It Down

Open Native PowerShell (Windows) or Terminal (Mac/Linux) in your **Documents** folder.
Type `git clone` and paste the project repo url, then hit ENTER to run.

Change this command to use the URL of YOUR GitHub repository.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/denisecase/datafun-03-analytics
```
