## Git Add-Commit-Push

After making changes on our machine, we need to:

1. Git add the files to source control
2. Git commit the files as a named set of changes
3. Git push the files to GitHub

Reading takes longer than the commands. The first times are more difficult, but we'll do these very often and you'll become skilled by the end of the course.

Open a terminal (PowerShell if Windows, default for Mac/Linux) and run each command one at a time, waiting for it to finish before running the next. 

Use the up arrow to access a previously entered command. 

```shell
git add .
git commit -m "Add .gitignore"
git push -u origin main
```


Always change the commit message to reflect what you did.
Professional communication skills make valuable team members.  

Later git pushes can be simplified - try just git push and see how it goes. 

```
git push
```

These are critical professional skills - congratulations!
