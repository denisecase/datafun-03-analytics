# datafun-03-analytics

This Python project works with data and requires libraries beyond the standard Python library. 
To avoid affecting the global Python environment, we create a local virtual environment and install the necessary packages there.

Setting up a virtual environment may seem challenging at first, but it’s an essential skill. 
By the end of this course, you’ll be comfortable with this workflow. Each step has a guide, but keeping your own notes is highly recommended. 
This process is fundamental to every significant analytics project.

## Prerequisites

Complete the following before starting on the Python script.

1. [Create and Clone a GitHub Repo](prereqs/01-CreateAndClone.md)
   - Create a new repo in GitHub with a default README.md.
   - Clone it to your Documents folder.
  
2. Open the project folder in VS Code.

3. Set up a Virtual Environment
   - Create and activate a virtual environment in a local folder named ".venv".
   - Install the necessary packages. 
   - [Set up Virtual Env on Windows](prereqs/02-SetUpVirtualEnv-Windows.md)
   - [Set up Virtual Env on Mac/Linux](prereqs/02-SetUpVirtualEnv-MacLinux.md)
   - IMPORTANT: Activate your .venv every time you work on the project. 

4. [Create a .gitignore File](prereqs/03-CreateGitIgnore.md)
   - Keep your repo clean by tracking only necessary files.

5. [Git Add-Commit-Push](prereqs/04-GitAddCommitPush.md) changes to GitHub

Congratulations! Prerequisites can be as much work as the project when learning Python.

## Start Your Project

Now that everything is set up, start coding in VS Code.

1. Sketch the project in comments.
1. Add the main method and a conditional execution block.
1. Verify it runs, then Git add-commit-push to GitHub.

Add your imports and some initial code. Verify it runs, then Git add-commit-push.

## Complete the Project

Work in small steps.

1. Implement a part of the project. 
2. Run the script to verify it works. 
3. Git add-commit-push with a meaningful commit message.

Repeat until the project is complete.
